# 🚀 PWM Servo Test - Start Here

## What Was Created

I've successfully converted your C firmware code into a complete Python cocotb verification test for the PWM servo control design.

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Setup Environment
```bash
cd /workspace/pwm_example
python verilog/dv/setup-cocotb.py $(pwd)
```

### Step 2: Run the Test
```bash
cd verilog/dv/cocotb
caravel_cocotb -t pwm_servo_test -tag pwm_test
```

### Step 3: Check Results
```bash
cat sim/pwm_test/RTL-pwm_servo_test/test.log
```

## 🎯 What the Test Does

The test verifies your PWM servo control design by:

1. **Configuring 4 PWM timers** at addresses:
   - PWM0: 0x30000000 → io_out[0]
   - PWM1: 0x30010000 → io_out[1]
   - PWM2: 0x30020000 → io_out[2]
   - PWM3: 0x30030000 → io_out[3]

2. **Testing 4 servo positions** (standard RC servo control):
   - **Phase 1**: Neutral (18000 ticks = 1500 μs = 0°)
   - **Phase 2**: Minimum (6000 ticks = 500 μs = -180°)
   - **Phase 3**: Neutral (18000 ticks = 1500 μs = 0°)
   - **Phase 4**: Maximum (30000 ticks = 2500 μs = +180°)

3. **Self-checking verification**:
   - Measures actual PWM pulse widths
   - Verifies they match expected values (with tolerance)
   - Reports pass/fail for each channel and phase
   - Total of **16 verification checks**

## ✅ Expected Output

When the test passes, you'll see:
```
[TEST] Starting PWM Servo Test
[TEST] Firmware configuration complete
[TEST] Phase 1: Testing neutral position (18000 ticks ~1500us)
[TEST] PWM0 average pulse width: 18000 cycles
[TEST] PWM0 pulse width PASSED
[TEST] PWM1 average pulse width: 18000 cycles
[TEST] PWM1 pulse width PASSED
...
[TEST] Test Summary: 16/16 checks passed
[TEST] PWM Servo Test PASSED
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Test doesn't run**
   → Check that you ran `setup-cocotb.py` first
   → Verify you're in the `verilog/dv/cocotb` directory

2. **Test times out**
   → Check firmware compilation log in `sim/pwm_test/RTL-pwm_servo_test/firmware.log`
   → View waveforms with GTKWave for debugging

3. **PWM measurements fail**
   → Review actual values in test.log
   → Check if tolerances need adjustment
   → Verify clock frequency is 12 MHz

For more detailed troubleshooting, see:
**verilog/dv/cocotb/pwm_servo_test/QUICK_START.md**

## 🎨 View Waveforms

To see the PWM signals in action:

```bash
gtkwave sim/pwm_test/RTL-pwm_servo_test/waves.vcd &
```

Key signals to add:
- `uut.mprj.io_out[3:0]` - PWM outputs
- `uut.chip_core.gpio` - Management GPIO (handshake)
- `uut.wbs_adr_i` - Wishbone address
- `uut.wbs_dat_i` - Wishbone data

## 📈 Next Steps

After successful test:

1. ✅ Review waveforms to understand timing
2. ✅ Run gate-level simulation: `caravel_cocotb -t pwm_servo_test -tag pwm_gl -sim GL`
3. ✅ Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
4. ✅ Add more test cases (different positions, edge cases)
5. ✅ Verify interrupt functionality
6. ✅ Test fault input behavior

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Quick questions**: Check QUICK_START.md troubleshooting section
2. **Understanding code**: Review CODE_MAPPING.md
3. **Understanding flow**: Review TEST_FLOW.md with diagrams
4. **Complete reference**: Read PWM_TEST_CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md
